<h3> HTML and CSS </h3>

	<p> HTML = Content: HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the building-blocks of web pages. HTML allows you to put images, text, videos, forms and other pieces of content together into a cohesive webpage. You can also tweak text words, resize images, and add links to either. </p>
	<p> CSS = Style: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) dictate your websites look and feel. Font size, font color, font type, styling around images, page layout, mouse-over effects and more are all determined by CSS. </p>
	<p> HTML is like the builder which carries the contents of the web page, whereas CSS is like the Artist, it's job is to style the contents within the page. Both work together to create a web page. The interactive part comes from the DOM and Javascript.</p>
