	<h1>Identity, Values and Strengths Activity</h1>
	<h3> Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Dicuss how you weughed up the valus involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took ?</h3>


	<h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity ?</h3>

	<p>I think family and togetherness is a very big part of who I am. Having it inbeded into me from such a young age and always having my big immediate family always around has showed me that supporting each other in good and especially bad times is what keeps us morally grounded and makes you embrace that love. I think this part of my culture definetly comes from my Fijian side. It's something I cherish alot and Im glad that my parents have given me this upbringing because as humans I think sometimes we forget a simple "thank-you or have a nice day" can go a very long way.</p> 

	<h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development?</h3>

	<p>My strengths would have to be open mindedness, easy-going and creativeness. These traits sum me up pretty nicely. I think the first two traits go hand-in hand. Im very willing to try new things to an extent of course, it allows me to be more versatile which in my opinion is a very valuable skill to have.</p>  
	<p>I've worked in various different group projects and I've always been the one willing to accept ideas and different methods of doing cetain projects. But I also think being easy-going can be a negative thing because you may be considered a push-over.</p>
	<p>The trait I pride myself on is being creative. I feel like not everyone has it in them to be creative so having this trait gives you an upper edge. I've just always been a very visual person a kid, which is why I think graphic design, animation and painting came naturally to me. I promise this isn't a flex. But I think having this trait is really important especially in this day and age, most things are exposed to us through visualisation and technology so I think I'd be good with Web Design.</p> 

	<p>My limitations would definetly have to be me time managment, public-speaking and sometimes motivation.</p> 
	<p>Im the type of person that loves to learn if im really interested in a particular subject. Like I said im a very visual person so if I can't physically see or touch what im learning my lack of motivation gets the best of me. For example writing is something that i try to avoid because I don't enjoy doing it and I waste time by distracting myself from the inevitable. Just like these cultural blogs. But when it comes to the point when it needs to be done i'll crack onto it.</p>
	<p>Public speaking for me is a no go. It's something thats definetly held me back all my life because im not able to share my ideas and projects with my class but it's just something that terrifies me.</p>

	<h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles ?</h3>

	<p>Being open-minded will definetly help me in my learning journey. To be able to learn new and different things that you wouldn't imagine approaching will definetly enhance your knowlodge. But in saying that being open-minded and willing to try things may result in not learning the right things or using all your your energy on something that isn't all that relavant to you</p> 
    
	<h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why ?<h3>
	
	<p>There was a group project I was working on with my friends. Each of us deligated tasks to do for each person, then the project would come together quicker and more effectively. Unfortunately one of my group member had a meltdwon and decided to not do any work, which landed us in a sticky situation. I tried talking to them to insure this is a team effort and everyone needs to pull there weight but there was no response. I took it into my own hands because it needed to be done and I didn't want to fail, but in doing that and allowing my kind nature to take over my team member took advantage of that.</p> 
	<p>Something I would try better next time is to maybe do weekly checkups with my team members to see that were all up to speed.</p>
