  <h1>Learning Refelctions</h1>

	<h3>Long Term Goal?</h3>

	<p>Main focus will obviously be gaining that certifaction of being a Web Developer. Gaining as much knowlodge as I can from these 3 months at EDA to set myself for my career path. Which leads to my 2 year plan to get a junior developer role hopefully as soon as finishing the course rather than later. Putting that hard work in for the couple of years to build some credibility so I can hopefully go overseas to work. I want to make use of my 2 year work visa that is available and travel while I continue to develope my skills, if not then I would like to gradually better my skills to get a higher role somewhere in Wellington.</p>

	<h3>What skills human skills would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>

	<p>My ability to be confident in talking publically or in groups which im unfamiliar with. I know it sounds silly but I think it'll set me up well once I get into the workforce.</p>
	<p>It's something I struggle with alot and I dont know how to overcome it and most times it hinders my ideas or projects that I want to showcase because im to nervous or shy to present.</p>

	<h3>Strengths and Limitations?</h3>

	<p>My curiosity and love for coding is definetly there, especially the visual parts like I've said before, letting my creative juices flow won't be a problem at all. But my time-management skills lack alot sometimes especially when something doesn't intruge me like writting but managing my time spent on sprints, and setting atleast 7-8 hours aside for studying will be my main priority.</p> 

	<h3>How will I manage the workload ?</h3>

	<p>Schedueling will be my bestfriend from here on. Setting certain tasks to get done throughout the day 5days through the week will be my new system. By evenly distributing the workload through the week I wont leave myself short of time at the end of the week where I'll have to play catch-up.</p> 

	<h3>Help!!</h3>

	<p>Asking for help sometimes seems foreign to me. I've always been the type of person that asks for help when im really stuck. It's something thats been my downfall because sometimes when im stuck I lose focus and get annoyed at the situation im in, but don't want to throw my burden or problem onto someone else. Which is a bad thing.</p>
	<p>Realising this course is pretty intense from the get go I think I'll approach more people like my cohorts or facilitator for help especially because things can get really frustrating if theres no one there to check your worok daily.</p> 

	<h3>Scheduling/Block-Out times?</h3>

	<p>Im a really sporty person so footy training 2 times a week - roughly 2hrs.</p>
	<p>Also recently love exercising, joined the gym 3 months ago - morning sessions take 1-2hrs.</p>
	<p>Gotta pay the bills somehow so - morning shifts 5-6hrs maybe once or twice a week. Im an uber driver so I pick my hours, when it gets closer to bootcamp or I've got too much workload to do I stop immediately. Easy Money !</p>
	<p>And then just spending time with family, friends and girlfriend. Helps keep the balance so im not stuck infront of the screen all day. Plus there a crazy bunch and love em</p>
