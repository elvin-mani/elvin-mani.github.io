  <h1> EQ/EI - Emotional Intelligence. </h1>

	<h3> What is Emotional Intelligence ? </h3>

	<p> EQ (Emotional Intelligence) measures how we as individuals learn, understand, and apply emotional knowledge. How well someone can understand their own and others emotions, to differentiate between them, 
		and to use that knowledge to guide your actions and behaviors.</p> 
	<p> This emotional intelligence (EI) aspects helps us measure of ability to be confident within ourselves and essentially knowing our self-worth, or  how much self-awarness we have when recognising something isn't right with our peers on a deeper level. Having these traits allows this person to be more easy going and enjoyable to work with or be around.</p>
	
	<h3> Difference between IQ and EQ ? </h3>
	
	<p> IQ measures your problem-solving skills, logical thinking skills, mathematics, a number of other fundamental skills that calculate to give your IQ level. Essentially, IQ tests measure how someone learns, understands and applies information.</p>
	<p> Having a higher definetly helps with everything in our lives, including our careers, our fundamental behaviors, our attention to driving a car, reading a book, and everything in between. Clearly, having a higher IQ can help progress your academic and professional career. Its based more on how intellectual you are rather than your emotional awarness.</p>
	
	<h3> Why is it important ? </h3>
	
	<p> I think its very important to have balance in both aspects of IQ and EQ levels. 
		Someone who is really intellectual may lack those social skills which holds them back from a promotion, or not being empathetic towards others may harm their personal lives. 
	<p> Having high IQ definetly helps with your career in the short term but EQ is something that catapultes your career futher and opens new doors for you. Gaining motivation and confidence within yourself is something that resonates with people, so definetly having a good balance of IQ and EQ is the way to go.</p>
